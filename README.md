# MANN (Memory Augmented Neural Networks)

Implemented of a black box meta-learner on Omniglot dataset using MANN (done as part of assignment for CS330).

Documentation of the results can be found in the pdf (CS330_Assignment_1.pdf)

To train the model run the following command
```
python hw1.py --num_classes 5 --num_samples 4
```

To use Neptune, make sure you insert you api_token in the main function in hw1.py
